# Brotato-Example-Mods

Examples of mods using ModLoader, specific to Brotato. Includes:

- **MenuString1** - Adds text to the title screen, after the version number
- **MenuString2** - Same as above. Demonstrates how mods can be chained, with each one taking effect after the last

For a generic example with lots of helpful comments, see [godot-mod-loader-examples](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader-examples).
